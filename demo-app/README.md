## Usage

This demo application have a single exchange called `myExchnage` with a single queue attached to it called `myQueue`.
The listener on the events of the queue can be found in the class `DemoListener`.

To send a message to the queue you can either use RabbitMQ dashboard and send the message over the exchange `myExchange`
with the routing key `my.routing.key` or use the service controller by sending the following command from your terminal:

```shell
curl -d "My message" -X POST http://localhost:8080/sendMessage
```

To test the retry mechanism go to the `DemoListener` and remove the comment of the RuntimeException bellow:
```java
//        throw new RuntimeException("Oh no! something bad happened :-(");
```
